# MNIST Digit Classifier

A browser-based MNIST digit classifier built with JavaScript and logistic regression. Users can train a model, draw digits on a canvas, and get real-time predictionsâ€”all running entirely in the browser.

### Goals

- [x] Download and load model weights  
- [x] Fully client-side training and inference  
- [x] Canvas-based digit drawing and preprocessing  
- [ ] Optimize model performance using WebGPU  
- [ ] Improve training and inference speed  
- [ ] Support more complex neural network architectures
